## Project Description
This is an **example** application for a grant programme: **Secret Network Grant Program: Secret Apps**

We intend to create a staking derivatives on Secret Network. More implementations will increase capital efficiecy in Secret Network and enable SCRT staked to secure Secret Network to be used in other Secret Network applications such as DeFi, governance and games.

Our team has been closely following Ethereum DeFi and Secret Network in the last year, and are active in the chat channels. Needless to say, we are really excited to see this project evolve.

## Problem / Solution
SCRT staked to secure Secret Network cannot be used in Secret Network ecosystem, creating a capital inefficiency. Staking derivatives (dxSCRT) allows SCRT holders to...

## Detailed product description
The components of staking derivatives (dxSCRT) contract include a validator set module that determines validator participation, staking module which handles bonded tokens and liquidity pool.

## Go-to-Market plan
As dxSCRT is a clear value proposition for existing SCRT holders, we hope to promote this effort within the Secret Network community

## Value capture for Secret Network ecosystem
The main KPIs for Secret Network is TVL (privacy value add to other blockchain ecosystems), number of transactions and number of user (for applications)

## Development Roadmap
We will require 3 months to complete this project. We intend to hav 2 developers full-time and 1 part-time, at a total cost of $X,000.

Example milestones:
* Implement X (weeks 0 - 4).
* Implement Y (weeks 4 - 8).
* Implement Z (weeks 8 - 12).

Ideally, we can receive payments in 3 disbursements, one at the beginning of the grant, one after implementation of Y and last payment when the development work is completed.

We would be willing to consider part payment in SCRTs, up to x%.
